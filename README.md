Unified Items is a mod to centralize ore generation and items into one simple to use package.
It is entirely modular by design and therefore only loads the necessary modules on runtime.
I have currently hardcoded the modules to just the major mods i know have updated to 1.10 (and Thermal Expansion because i started on this in 1.7).
In the future i plan to add a json based module system that way users can make their own modules and customize it to their liking.
